# React & Quote Generator App

This Quote Generator app is designed to display random quotes fetched from a third-party API service. Users can explore new quotes, bookmark their favorite ones, and view them later in the bookmarks section. It uses React version **18.2** and Tailwind CSS version **3.2**.

## Usage
## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to create a web application that generates random quotes using a third-party API. The app should have features such as quote generation, bookmarking, and tag-based filtering. Additionally, it should reflect a visually appealing design and be responsive across different devices.
This starter pack includes a basic setup for using **Tailwind CSS with React**. To start building your own components and styles, follow these steps:



1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Karansingh7511/Random-quote-generator.git
    ```

1. Install the required packages.
    ```sh
    cd Random-quote-generator
    npm install
    ```

1. Start the development server.
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
1. Open the project in your browser at [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) to view your project.
1. Create your React components and add your styles using Tailwind classes. You can also create new CSS files and import them into your components.

The project is set up to use `postcss-cli` to process your CSS files. You can add your own `tailwind.config.js` file to customize your Tailwind setup.
